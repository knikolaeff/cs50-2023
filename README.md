# cs50-2023

My solutions to [CS50 2023](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) labs and problem sets

**IMPORTANT**: I don't use the cs50.h library because I have prior programming experience, so I wanted to give myself a challenge and try to do everything using nothing but C standard library.
